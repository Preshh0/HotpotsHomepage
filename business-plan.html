							<p>Get To Know Us Better!</p>
							<h2>Our Grand Plan</h2>

						<p> 

							Professionals spend a lot of time trying to develop solutions for the real world and that are helpful to a lot of people, both directly and indirectly and yet most of the time their health is at risk; 
							both mentally and physically or they have so little time to spend on the things that really matter (like; adequate rest), and that is not okay. There are two ways I know I can help with this: 
							<ul>
								<li>
									By lifting the burden of figuring out what to eat by providing it for you based on a pre-chosen menu by you so you can spend less time worrying about what to eat or how to prepare it or where youâ€™d order from (assuming you have access to those kinds of options in your area)
									and more time resting or rejuvenating or spending quality time with the people you care about. 
								</li>
								<li>
									By making sure you eat and stay healthy through end of the month evaluations.  
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

							<strong>Thank you for being a part of our journey!</strong>
